Spotify Feature Analysis 
Song popularity is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the song's audio features, lyrics, and artist. While there is no single formula for predicting song popularity, researchers have identified a number of audio features that are correlated with popularity. One of the most well-studied audio features is loudness. Studies have shown that louder songs are generally more popular than quieter songs. This is likely because louder songs are more attention-grabbing and easier to hear in noisy environments. Another important audio feature is valence, which measures the emotional tone of a song. Valence can be positive or negative
